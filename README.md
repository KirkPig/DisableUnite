# The Wimpies Unite

In this cruel world, in a dungeon. Dungeon mobs: Bat, Plant and Slime, too tired to be a mob in a dungeon. You are the guiding spirit wandering in the dungeon, having pity for the wimpy gang, so you decide to guide them by controlling them. 

Help a blind bat, a noisy plant-in-a-pot and an airhead slime escape this cruel dungeon!

**For the Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1 with the theme of "Stronger Together"**

## Introduction for the characters
 
Bat: You know, a bat. Its eyesight is too bad to see things, but it could see rhythm of sound. But hey! At least it can move itself. Without sonar sensing ability, it needs the wide-ranging vision of plant to move without flaw.
 
Noisy Plant-in-a-pot: No ordinary plant has eyes. It could see, but sadly it could not move. It needs the Bat’s help to move! Also, it can make a sound, which calls slime from everywhere!
 
Slime: The brainless jelly-like being, the plant’s pet. Possessing no sign of intelligence. Not even you, the almighty spirit could control it. It only reacts to sound and it will go “STRAIGHT” to it (Well, at least it tries to because the game is tile-based).  

You: A mighty deaf spirit so you cannot hear any sound, even effect or bgm ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Controls

## Gameplay
-	The goal: Help the wimpy gang reach their goal!
-	Water:  If you push the magic block down, the block will become floor. Also, the character will die if it goes into water, including a flying bat lmao.

-	Lava: yeah, a lava, everything move into it will be melted.

-	Wall: Just standing there menacingly, born to block everything in its path

-	Button: Use to operate alarm, conveyer belt, and gate

-	Door: Wooden Door, requires an exact number of keys, labeled on the door, to open

-	Gate: Heavy Metal Door, use button to open/close

-	Alarm: Emitting sound, also called slime. The slime will prioritize the plant sound if both are emitting sound.

-	Conveyor Belt: move everything on belt in the marked direction

-	Trap Floor: Below it is the pitfall trap, the floor will open in the certain time. 
Given that the dungeon is high-tech enough to own a clock.

-	Magic block: a block condensed with magic. Push it into water to create floor!
